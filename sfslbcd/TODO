* relax write back consistency
  - optimzie write after open
  - optimize write right after flush/close
  - optimize read: if we receives a request with first byte at N > 0,
    fetch til EOF before fetch beginning part of the file

cache readdir replies

run file system correctness tests on lbfs and lbfs-a. make sure things
like close, setattr, getattr ends up returning the right attr even if
the flush to server was not finished

write test cases for
 - open, open, write, close, write, close

lbfs: rename the cached file to another name before fetching a new
version; so we retain the old data
