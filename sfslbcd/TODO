* intercept attribute returned from ACCESS for dirty files
* don't update attribute cache's size field on each WRITE
* relax write back consistency
  - optimize write right after flush/close

partial file fetch - when should we fetch entire file, when should we
wait for read before fetch

write test cases for
 - open, open, write, close, write, close

lbfs: rename the cached file to another name before fetching a new
version; so we retain the old data
