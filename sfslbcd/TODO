fix permission problem with make-doc

partial file caching - don't need to fetch entire file before
returning

optimize
 - setattr right after open
 - write right after open

write test cases for
 - open, open, write, close, write, close

lbfs: rename the cached file to another name before fetching a new
version; so we retain the old data
