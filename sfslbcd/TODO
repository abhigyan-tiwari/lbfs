minimize number of RPCs to server; for those that need to go to
server; can we be optimistic about them?

run file system correctness tests on lbfs and lbfs-a. make sure things
like close, setattr, getattr ends up returning the right attr even if
the flush to server was not finished

write test cases for
 - open, open, write, close, write, close

lbfs: rename the cached file to another name before fetching a new
version; so we retain the old data
